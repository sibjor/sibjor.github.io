            <h2>Welcome! About me:</h2>
            <p>
                I'm currently studying game programming in my hometown, Stockholm, hoping to someday contribute meaningfully to my passions. 
                I believe in building things that heal, entertain, and inspire.
                I am also homebrewer of sour ales which I enjoy sharing about twice a month.
                My brother runs a <a href="https://vinverket.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wine bar</a>, owned by my father, in the heart of Stockholm. I usually bring my friends. You should visit!
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Before this, I worked in high cuisine — both in Sweden and abroad. 
                I speak English, Swedish, some French, and not to forget... Syntax!
            </p><br>
            <p>
                I try to stay occupied with my interests — which is currently almost 100% true, 
                aside from doing laundry and travelling by public transport.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm curious about the future, and I try to stay optimistic — and actually manage to do so quite well.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                I am also sort of mentoring my sister, trying to involve her in my private projects sometimes. 
                She's a talented soul and just started learning some software as well as some basic programming. 
                I think she's doing a really good job as a junior artist. Currently, I motivate her to do pixel designs and CSS artwork.
                And she recently moved to Nice in France, how awesome is that?<br>
                Check out her website here:

                Sometimes chaotic, sometimes structured — always honest.
